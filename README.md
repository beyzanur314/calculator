Introduction:
Welcome to the Rust Calculator Project Description, where we will outline the key features and objectives of our calculator application developed in the Rust programming language. Rust is known for its safety, performance, and reliability, making it an excellent choice for building robust software.

Project Overview:
Our goal is to create a user-friendly, efficient, and versatile calculator that can perform a wide range of mathematical operations. This calculator project will not only help us practice and showcase our Rust programming skills but also provide a useful tool for anyone who needs quick and accurate calculations.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: We will design an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) to ensure a seamless user experience.

Basic Operations: The calculator will support fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Functions: We will incorporate advanced functions such as square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and more to cater to various mathematical needs.

History and Memory: Users will have the option to view a history of their calculations and store results in memory for future reference.

Error Handling: The application will be designed to handle errors gracefully, providing informative messages when incorrect inputs are provided.

Unit Conversion: We will include a unit conversion feature to help users with common unit conversions, such as length, weight, and temperature.

Scientific Mode: For advanced users, a scientific mode will be available with additional mathematical functions and constants.

Customization: Users will be able to customize the calculator's appearance and behavior to suit their preferences.

Development Plan:
We will follow a structured development plan, including the following phases:

Design: We will create wireframes and design the user interface to ensure a clean and intuitive layout.

Implementation: The calculator application will be developed in Rust, utilizing the language's safety and performance features.

Testing: Rigorous testing will be conducted to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

Documentation: We will provide comprehensive documentation to help users understand how to use the calculator effectively.

Deployment: The calculator application will be made available for various platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Future Updates: We plan to continuously improve the application by adding new features and addressing user feedback.
